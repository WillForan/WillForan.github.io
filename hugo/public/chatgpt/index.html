    <div class="content">
      <p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3#Training_and_capabilities">60% of GPT-3s training</a> is common crawl, an archive of text that makes up the internet.
As people use large language models to add text to the internet, the models could end up with their own output as training input.
Unchecked, the models will degrade: garbage in, garbage out. Instead of artificial intelligence recursively improving itself in the positive-feedback loop leading to the singularity, the output of the internet-as-a-corpus trained AI will repeatedly amplify noise and produce worsening results. It&#39;s the inverse singularity.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the humans reviewing, tweaking, and validating e.g. <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned">generated stack overflow answers</a> could help the models. The new training data will have subtitle updates that specifically target previously unknown weak points â€“ it&#39;s original output but with important corrections. </p>
<p>
As much as human reviewers will nudge the language model, the larger change could be to content and style of the people using LLMs output. Does <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90205359/google-you-auto-complete-me">autocomplete make our communications more homogeneous?</a> There&#39;s evidence even all individuals in large markets will conform to model expectations (<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/374404">Black-Scholes model CBOE from 30% off to 2% b/c arbitrage</a>, via <a href="https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/">Doughnut Economics</a>)! Is our convergence to machine speak elevation or regression?</p>
