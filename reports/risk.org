* Stats
  using attack information parsed from the logs.
  We can compute attacking stats.

 N.B. The defending player is not currently tracked. Statitics are only for aggression.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :var d=results-attacks :colnames yes
  library(dplyr)
  top_attack <-
    d %>%
    group_by(a.player, d.player) %>% tally() %>%
    group_by(a.player) %>% mutate(r=rank(n)) %>%
    filter(r<2) %>% summarize(most.attacked=paste(d.player,collapse=","))

   x <-
    d %>% 
    group_by(a.player) %>%
    summarise(attacks=n(),
    	    losses=sum(a.lost),
    	    kills=sum(d.lost),
    	    win.ratio=length(which(status=='captured'))/n(),
    	    avg.attack.disparity=mean(a.n - d.n)) %>%
    mutate_at(.funs=function(x) round(x,2), vars(win.ratio, avg.attack.disparity)) %>%
    #inner_join(top_attack) %>%
