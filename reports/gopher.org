* Gopher server
I've added a gopher server to mirror content. I can not image it will be used seriously, but it seems important.

Gopher links to raw org text files. github.io gets prettified html.

* Implementation

My first attempt was with https://github.com/puckipedia/pyGopher. I didn't spend enough time digging for documentation.
Much later, I found *geomyidae* linked from suckless tools. By timing coincidence or by man page, it clicked.
  
#+BEGIN_SRC bash

  git clone git://r-36.net/geomyidae
  cd geomyidae
  make
  # man ./geomyidae.8 
  echo [1|test desc|/test.txt|server|70] >> /var/gopher/index.gph
  # run server with explict hostname ("server" in links), log everything (31)
  sudo ./geomyidae -d -v 31 -h www.xn--4-cmb.com
  
#+END_SRC
